A2E43JUCG5WGVZ,B01E6HQJMA,"I got these in white and they are so cute.  I imagine these would work perfectly for a nighttime wedding.  I put them up on the inside roof of my pagoda to add to the lights I have around and along the poles.  They are not super bright so don't expect to have them be a major light source but they give off a nice ambient glow which is what I was looking for.  They are super easy to set up - just unwrap, hang and put your solar panel in the ground.  My pagoda is on my 2nd story deck so I just put my solar panel in a pot of flowers and I'm good to go.  Solar lights really are the way to go when looking for year round ambient lighting. When I put these up they only got about 3 hours of sunlight to charge but they were glowing strong well into the night.  These even have a couple modes for blinking with several speeds, twinkling and steady on.  I love them!","i got these in white and they are so cute. i imagine these would work perfectly for a nighttime wedding. i put them up on the inside roof of my pagoda to add to the lights i have around and along the poles. they are not super bright so don't expect to have them be a major light source but they give off a nice ambient glow which is what i was looking for. they are super easy to set up - just unwrap, hang and put your solar panel in the ground. my pagoda is on my 2nd story deck so i just put my solar panel in a pot of flowers and i'm good to go. solar lights really are the way to go when looking for year round ambient lighting. when i put these up they only got about 3 hours of sunlight to charge but they were glowing strong well into the night. these even have a couple modes for blinking with several speeds, twinkling and steady on. i love them!",175.0
A2N3TE6ML4B9QQ,B000T3KY5Y,"Cannot express how disappointed I am in this slicer. I tried to slice up a pork belly for bacon after smoking it and chilling it, and it was more of a meat shredder than a meat slicer. After I took the blade off to clean the machine, I realized that the blade was dull. I am not impressed with the size of the meat sled either. With a 9"" blade, I would expect the carriage to be large enough to hold the width of a pork belly. Unfortunately this was not the case. If what you are slicing is wider than about 7 inches, you will have to lift up one side of the meat to finagle it through the blade. Definitely do your research on slicers!!","cannot express how disappointed i am in this slicer. i tried to slice up a pork belly for bacon after smoking it and chilling it, and it was more of a meat shredder than a meat slicer. after i took the blade off to clean the machine, i realized that the blade was dull. i am not impressed with the size of the meat sled either. with a 9"" blade, i would expect the carriage to be large enough to hold the width of a pork belly. unfortunately this was not the case. if what you are slicing is wider than about 7 inches, you will have to lift up one side of the meat to finagle it through the blade. definitely do your research on slicers!!",127.0

A1QJO5BWBV04OP,B00002N8CX,"UPDATE at 3/8/13:  I'm still disappointed with the function of the accessories, but the suction is really good.  So I've decided to make do until the bags I purchased are used up.  I still had the floor tools from my deceased Dirt Devil canister, and they work okay with this vacuum. I only use the Eureka floor tool in the storage room and garage where my cats spend the night. It works okay on the vinyl/concrete/utility rugs, and on the carpeted cat scratcher.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Did my research and had such high hopes, but this vacuum is a big disappointment.  The unit and accessories appear as described, and it sounds strong and has good suction from the open pipe.

Except, not.  My house has bare floors and large (9x12) wool or cotton rugs, and 3 cats.  After going over the kitchen, I turned around and saw the same onion skin and pet hair just mocking me.  Then I spent 20 minutes on the living room rug, and afterwards it looked like only I'd crawled around picking lint by hand.  Other gripes: the flexible hose kinks flat/closed (doesn't self correct), the floor tool clogs about every 90 seconds in both brush positions (and must be cleared WITH FINGERS, the debris doesn't suck off by the pipe alone).

I don't have the heart to go in to more detail.  I'm not sure how I'll get my floors clean with this device.  This blew the budget I had to replace a 15 year old, $40, Dirt Devil little red canister (that finally burned out).  Harrumph.","update at 3/8/13: i'm still disappointed with the function of the accessories, but the suction is really good. so i've decided to make do until the bags i purchased are used up. i still had the floor tools from my deceased dirt devil canister, and they work okay with this vacuum. i only use the eureka floor tool in the storage room and garage where my cats spend the night. it works okay on the vinyl/concrete/utility rugs, and on the carpeted cat scratcher.

A15V6EFFG0T2NQ,B01B8CQC6Y,"I ordered this for a friend who loves to make Greek coffee. If you don't know, Greek coffee is usually a smaller amount of coffee. So I wanted to get her a travel mug that was small enough to not force her to tip back the mug too far just for a sip (Greek coffee has the grounds still in it so if you tip too far you get a mouthful of grounds - NOT pleasant). Not only was this the perfect size, but it keeps her coffee hot all the way to work and through the morning. The only small complaint I have is that the lid does not twist or snap shut, so the hole you drink from stays open all the time. This is not ideal for travel as it tends to splash a little.

A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B00SS3XAIK,"These measuring cups were designed not just for accurate measuring of dry and wet ingredients, but also to hang near your food prep area, for gourmet residential kitchens, and in restaurant kitchen. You have five heavy duty stainless steel cups, marked for both English and Metric measuring. (1 cup = 250ml, 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/4 cup, 1/8 cup.)  When you're doing fast food prep, you don't have time to dig out a measuring cup, and eye it to get it level with the mark on the glass. You just grab your 1/2 cup measuring cup, dip it in the sugar bag, and use a knife to knock off any sugar above the top of the cup. That's your exact measure, not what you eye up the best you can with a measuring cup. Using these results is a much more accurate, and quick, means to measure your ingredients, both wet and dry.  Since they're stainless steel, they're easy to keep clean. Plus, they look very nice hanging up. This is the way to go, if you're running a top notch kitchen, either professionally or for your family and domestic staff.

A3A15L96IYUO6V,B00OCEBMH0,"I was excited about receiving this dish mat to help protect my glass dishes from chipping with the porcelain sink in my apartment. It has fit the bill nicely, and there's certainly less clanging going on when I set stuff down in the sink. After a couple weeks' worth of use, the silicone mat does easily stay clean -- food does not stick to it easily. You can also put a hot pan directly in your sink this way, since it will dissipate the heat from the sink's surface.

It was easy to cut out a section for the drain (mine is in the dead center), but the biggest negative is that OXO doesn't offer an ""extra large"" size that's a few inches wider since I only have a single basin sink. Using the mat does make one's sink a little bit harder to clean, but that's moot because the mat can be easily removed at anytime (it's never permanently affixed to the sink.) I recommend the product highly and I expect it to last a long time.","i was excited about receiving this dish mat to help protect my glass dishes from chipping with the porcelain sink in my apartment. it has fit the bill nicely, and there's certainly less clanging going on when i set stuff down in the sink. after a couple weeks' worth of use, the silicone mat does easily stay clean -- food does not stick to it easily. you can also put a hot pan directly in your sink this way, since it will dissipate the heat from the sink's surface.

A2Q7DE6NA7VKAJ,B000E57BBW,"Cuisinart 735-16OP Chef's Classic Stainless 1-Quart Pour Saucier, by Cuisinart.
The top of this stainless steel saucepan has an internal width of 6  inches, and an exterior width of 6  inches. The bottom of the pan is only about 4 1/8 inches wide, why, I don't know.  The pan has to be at least half full to sit level, even on a glass top stove, due to the weight of the handle. I would not recommend it for use on an older stove that uses grates over gas, or grates over electric coils, as the grates will make it prone to tipping over.  This is one of the few times when I would rather see a wider and heavier bottom (drum roll, please......badda-boom!.....(-;).  The Amazon catalog picture is a bit different, as the pan I have has a mirror finish on the outside, and a brushed finish on the inside.  The picture has a matte finish on the outside and a brushed finish on the inside. The model numbers are the same, only mine has an extra number of 0714 on the package, but the number 0614 is stamped on the bottom of the pan.  Perhaps the series is being modified.  It would be nice if the pan had a pour spout on each side, but the pan has a rolled edge anyway, so a spout isn't really needed, it just gives you a slower pour. I like the pour spout, but due to the narrow bottom and the lack of a cover, I can only give this pan three stars.

A2X9B511AX3OT9,B00GXGXRFK,"PROS: I've had this comforter for four years and I will say it is the most beautiful set. I am obsessed with the look of is and never get sick of walking in my room and seeing it. It is also VERY comfy and always feels like a cloud.  CONS: (1.) it WILL rip, quick and all over the place. Due to the way it's sewn in horizontal sections it rips when you pull it up at night (I hate that my mom said it won't hold up well and she was right). I have sewn this comforter more times than I can count and it still rips. (2) difficult to wash, the minute you wash it the filling starts to get all messed up on the inside, and when I see it held up to a light I can see how clumpy it is in between the sections. BUT, with all of that being said, due to the layers and rouched nature of it, it is hard to see stuffing inside. So if you want a pretty comforter that won't hold up great, difficult to wash by your willing to sew or be really careful then go for it. Again, my relationship is a hate/love because it's beautiful just poorly constructed.","pros: i've had this comforter for four years and i will say it is the most beautiful set. i am obsessed with the look of is and never get sick of walking in my room and seeing it. it is also very comfy and always feels like a cloud. cons: (1.) it will rip, quick and all over the place. due to the way it's sewn in horizontal sections it rips when you pull it up at night (i hate that my mom said it won't hold up well and she was right). i have sewn this comforter more times than i can count and it still rips.

The reason is, in the bake cycle the top heating element come on and as a result the top crust of your food will burn before it is done.

(1) Stainless steel everywhere that it counts.  No plastic is in touch with the boiling water.  (2) I liked the idea of the double-wall so that I wouldn't get burned if I touched the outside.  However, there is an added bonus that the water stays much hotter longer, after it turns off. (3) Some reviews said it's loud, but I wasn't worried about that when I bought it.

(1) stainless steel everywhere that it counts. no plastic is in touch with the boiling water. (2) i liked the idea of the double-wall so that i wouldn't get burned if i touched the outside. however, there is an added bonus that the water stays much hotter longer, after it turns off.

This boot rack holds three pairs of boots.  It holds them upside down.  Hanging them upside down like this helps them keep their shape, no more flopped over, creased boots.  It also keeps boots from falling over when standing up.
This rack is 21.5 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 22 inches tall.  It is made of polymer plastic and metal.  It does not come assembled, but it is very easy to put together.  The boot rack just snaps together, you don't need any tools.  I bought this for my Mom's mud room.  Hanging their muck boots upside down will help make sure they are dried out by the time they need them again.  There is nothing worse than going out to do evening chores, and finding out your boots have a pool of water in the toe from morning chores.  This boot rack is going to be great through the wet spring months.
So far, it has held up well.  Muck brand boots are very heavy for boots.  Maybe 3-4 lbs per pair.  This rack has held them up with no problems.  They go on, and come off very easily too.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All opinions and experiences gained from reviewing this product are my own.","sorbus boot rack-

A1USINTIMCZNPR,B01FJPS8EA,"I'm fairly pleased with this product. I agree with many of the reviews on the large amount of wasted food, as it's TRiCKY with some sizes and textures of veggies to get them to spiral instead of just smashing. For some veggies, you must trim the end at just the right angle, turn it on, then SLAM DOWN the veggie onto the blade. Proper alignment of the top and the blade is also pointlesly DIFFICULT. But for the 70% of veggies which it will work for, out of all the ones you would expect it to work for, it WORKS WELL. Since the blade spins, while the veggie stays still, you get a perfect pile of NEAT SPIRALS. Other designs which spin the veggie, while the blade stays still, produce piles of twisted spirals (like a tangled phone cord). I find that it's easy to clean with a dish brush. I'm returning this product only because the GOURMIA, of similar design, includes one more BLADE.

A1UXI7QJZZMTNJ,B00DBTOVXO,"I'm happy with my purchase.  I did a lot of researching before choosing this cleaner.  I didn't need the top of the line pricey model, I was just looking for something that could pull up the deep pet fur and freshen the carpet.  It does this very well.  It may have pulled up a few lighter stains, but the hard stains are still there, which I expected.  We have had 3 pet accidents (vomit, pee, and diarrhea) since we got it and it has cleaned them all and left the carpet fresh.  That is worth the $$ right there.
I want to share a carpet cleaning tip I got from a professional carpet cleaner: When cleaning the whole carpet, instead of adding the cleaning solution to the tank, mix it in a sprayer (one of the soaking kind like a bug sprayer or deck refinisher) and spray the solution on the carpet 30 min before you run the carpet cleaner.  Then add just plain hot water to the carpet cleaner.  This does a better job and you don't need to worry about the soap clogging the lines.

2. The packaging was terrible. It was merely cardboard over the picture with no other padding or protection. The box was damaged and I could see the print inside. Luckily there was no damage to the print.

A3GMRYV7VAYK5Q,B00WDZOPFQ,"I was so excited to get this Ice Crusher because I had dreams of frozen drinks for myself and snow-cones for my kids. First, the direction were abysmal but eventually I did figure it out. Everything except the blade is plastic on this unit. The plug has a handy storage compartment on the underside of the unit but the door has to be completely removed. This makes it very likely to get lost since it is about the size of a 9 volt battery. Also, no recipes were included, which I found to be a bit odd.

The hopper holds exactly 14 ice cubes from a regular ice maker and that will fill the cup about half way once crushed. The fine setting (which I was most interested in) might be good for a snow cone but certainly not the type of frozen slushy drinks that adults like. The ice gets crushed down to about the size of a small lady bug.

Overall, I had high hopes for this machine but it fell a bit short. For snow cones, I think my kids will be happy but it looks like I will have to go to an adult drinking establishment if I want a frozen margarita.","i was so excited to get this ice crusher because i had dreams of frozen drinks for myself and snow-cones for my kids. first, the direction were abysmal but eventually i did figure it out. everything except the blade is plastic on this unit. the plug has a handy storage compartment on the underside of the unit but the door has to be completely removed. this makes it very likely to get lost since it is about the size of a 9 volt battery. also, no recipes were included, which i found to be a bit odd.

A2QY76397T50KC,B002NTSGSO,"I adore this little fountain! It's perfect for a small corner of an office space. Unlike other table fountains I previously owned, this one does not splash. Instead, the water gently cascades down the grooves. It does not look like cheap plastic - more like old metal covered with patina and some moss (painted on but looks pretty realistic). I had no problems with any of the components, they all came intact and fit well (except for the light stand which somehow ends up a little crooked. The lighting is my favorite part, it makes a big difference and I love staring at it in a low light environment. You can hardly hear the pump, it's so silent. Perhaps the whole fountain is a little too silent for my taste. As I mentioned earlier, the water cascades gently and you can barely hear the water either which to me is the whole point of getting a fountain - to hear the relaxing tinkle of water in the background while I work. So I got myself some white sea glass (crystals, from a handicraft store) and made a little pile against the grooves on the front of the fountain where the water trickles down. Depending on how you arrange the glass crystals (or you can get small pebbles, whatever you prefer), you can increase the sound of water tinkling. When the crystals got wet, it looks like wet ice sitting in the fountain which is very cool looking.

A1XNLDHWASQ8IT,B00284BM3A,"I really like this vacuum but took off 1 star because (a) technologically, it's not really anything new and (b) even as easy as it is, I hate having to worry about multiple filters.

This vacuum performs very well. Although slightly bulky, it maneuvers easily around tight spaces. Even when full of rabbit hair, it still sucked up more dirt and didn't seem to lose suction. Cleanup takes less than 5 minutes, 10 max if you're a neat freak.

I recommend rinsing the sponge-like ring filter after every use and leaving it around to dry around the handle. That way you don't have to leave it out and wait for it to dry. Just put the vacuum away and the next time you need to vacuum, put the filter back on and lock the canister in place. Takes only a minute.

If I had to say anything bad it would be about the tube you put your attachments on. It's short and doesn't stretch very far. The vacuum toppled over a few times when I used it. Not a big deal if you use 1 hand to hold part of the tube (near vacuum) and another (on the attachment end handle) to stretch it out and clean. It takes a little bit getting used to.

All in all, I'm happy with my decision.
This is replacing my old canister vacuum which I loved but crapped out on me after years and years of use.

WAIT on your banana's to turn leopard skinned, then cut them into 1 inch ""coins"" and lay them onto a cookie sheet covered with wax paper. Toss them in the freezer. Leave them until SOLID. Once they're solid, vacuum seal or ziplock them up. Figure on 1 large or 2 medium banana's per person per portion. Remember, you will be using frozen strawberries, peaches, and pineapples (and other fruits). The bulk of the treats we make are about 65% banana, 35% other stuff. I prefer banana and pineapple.

BEFORE you grind these into ""ice cream"", take them and your other frozen fruits from the freezer and set them on the counter until they are slightly soft. Don't let them thaw completely, or else your treats will turn into a mixture of semi cold goo which closely resembles the puke stains seen on cab floors.

Stick a bowl under the mouth of the machine to catch the product. Do not try to catch it into an ice cream cone. You will look dumb for even trying. This can all be done by one person, but works best with an assistant. I would like Vanna White to assist. She doesn't return my calls.

I got it for lasagna in my Instant Pot as it was recommended by a blogger who loved it for that. Mine did leak, but only a little and it was fine. The lasagna was amazing by the way. My BIGGEST complaint with this pan (and other baking or glassware products) is they put very sticky stickers on them and they are very hard to remove the residue left over. The one on the side of the pan (big red on in the ad pic) came off cleanly but there was one on the removable bottom that left a very sticky blob. I scrubbed, scraped, tried coconut oil and baking soda and it is still there.

It makes a really hot cup of coffee (would be perfect for hot tea too). But takes just under 3 min to brew one cup.

The method is simple like most single cup brewers without a water without water holding tanks. Open the top (by turning lock knob on top). Pour cup of water in, place k-cup in, close top, push button on side and wait.

It is pretty small so if you have a space issue this would be ideal. You can not fit a tall travel mug under to brew directly into that - mine wouldn't fit with or without the little stand that the mug sits on. So for that I removed 1 star.

I also have a Krups espresso maker that has a nice in-between result, but it and the Moka are both slower and messier to work with.

One possible downside with the AeroPress is that you may find you need to use a lot more coffee than you are used to using to generate the same strong, dark result.

ARC28NOTOR4GQ,B001UFX61O,"5 stars for design - 1 star for Quality = 2 stars.
Old outdoor line broke last week after 18 years. This one had advantage, can move indoors on wet days and light enough for wife to move by herself.
Arrived with no visible damage to packaging, yet one plastic line tensioner/anchor arrived broken.
Upon assembling, was dismayed to discover that the factory was so sloppy, that both cross-braces were useless! Four of the PEM-nuts (clinch nuts) were never clinched, and slid right out of the holes. At least one of the remaining nuts was only half-clinched. (see photos)
I'm not going to return this. I used some epoxy to try to glue the nuts in. It's too much hassle to shlep the very long 25 pound box back to UPS or whatever (I never read the return policy).
I just hope I get one season out of this fairly expensive product before the re-enforced plastic main brackets crack. We will treat it gently and hope for the best.","5 stars for design - 1 star for quality = 2 stars.

Hanging these pictures is so incredibly easy using the templates.

We have had a top-of-the-line Serta iComfort adjustable split King bed for two years, and it is the worst bed ever... it just sucks you down in and you wake up sore and stiff... sore hips, back and legs... not to mention how hard it is to get up out of it every time. But when you have spent nearly $6000 on a bed... you sure don't want to buy a new one two years later.  So... I thought I would give this one last try to fix the problem...

We opened up the Serta mattress by just zipping off the top cover, and then pulled off the top soft memory foam layer (it was glued down so it took some work) of the iComfort bed. Then simple replaced it with the 3"" latex topper and zipped the cover back on and made the bed as usual. The first night I had a little stiffness, the second night was better, and by the third night I was sleeping great. And I can simply sit up and get out of bed without the struggle.

(if you have shag carpet this would be an ideal sweeper) i used my old sweeper after i used the dyson, and it picked up twice as much dirt. i wish i would have spent my money on another vacuum. i started writing this review giving it a 4star, but found out that i am still a little bit bitter about the price. your money will be better spent on another vac.",161.0

AMS2CPERWN7JV,B00AL2AV2O,"While most foodsaver bags I really like, I kind of have a love/hate relationship with the expandable bags so far.

Basically it's nearly the same as a normal foodsaver flat bag, except on the top section there are a couple of pleats.  This allows it to expand and store larger items that wouldn't normally fit in a bag.  That part is great, since there are large chunks of meat that sometimes do not fit easily (large pork shoulders, etc).  The downside is you have to leave a lot of bag on the other side to make sure you get the pleats folded back up correctly and make sure they vacuum seal.  It's a bit trickier to vacuum seal as well since there are more places for air to hide.

So they offer some downsides, more expensive, trickier to use, but the upside is you can store items that you couldn't before.","while most foodsaver bags i really like, i kind of have a love/hate relationship with the expandable bags so far.

A30ODR6WBE61UB,B01CHT48C2,"Time to upgrade my dry-food storage systema hodge-podge of heavy glass containers and re-purposed plastic food containers.

This light and space-saving set works perfectly.

PROS:

I love that they stack. (If you have more vertical than horizontal space, as I do, make two stacks.)
The seal is tight; keeps items fresh. (Probably little-critter-free, too...e.g. moths, weevils.)
Plastic seems of good sturdy quality and is said by the manufacturer to be BPA free. (I won't be storing liquids, so that seems less of an issue, anyway.)
Light enough to grab from my tallest shelf without worrying it will fall on my head and knock me out (as with my glass jars).
Arthritis-ridden hands will appreciate the rather effortless open/close.
Comes shipped securely in its own box.

CONS:

None that I can identify.

If I'm smart, I will purchase several more sets, to maximize storage space in the neatest way possible.

Note: A bit of awkward wording on the box makes it unclear: Is this set dishwasher-safe? The answer no, only the slim rubber caskets that form the seal can be put in the dishwasher.  But it's easy enough to wash these: Afterward, give the tops a little shake and turn upside down, to get out all the water.","time to upgrade my dry-food storage systema hodge-podge of heavy glass containers and re-purposed plastic food containers.

Ought to protect against any pests and well as dust. It will keep cooking odors from the kitchen from getting embedded in the cloth. I am extremely pleased.

A1K088IT078NE4,B00LCN7XZY,"Works better than my big Vitamix for blending up small smoothies. Pulse the smoothie for best results.  So easy too because you can add the black screw on to-go lid to the cup after you're done blending your drink.  I ordered a 2nd large blending cup and black lid on the Ninja website ($28) Pricy, but I wanted 2 large cups for me and my husband. Just blend, add black top and a big smoothie straw and your ready to go.  Rinse the blade immediately after use and its super easy to maintain.  Great for students who need protein drinks, and people who want convenience, quality and ease of clean up.  Caution:  when assembling the blade assembly to the cup, be extremely vigilant in making sure that the blade assembly is on STRAIGHT and EVEN or you will make a big mess and smoothie will dribble out everywhere!

A3U24WYRQLNQ0Z,B000CAWQXC,"This peeler is literally this most amazing peeler I've ever used in my life, and I've used many a peeler in my years.  First of all, and most importantly, it has a scary sharp ninja-honed peel murdering blade.  The white ceramic insert is dangerously sharp... if you're a veggie anyhow.  It makes peeling anything ridiculously easy, we're talking hot knife through room temperature butter easy.  The handle is super comfortable and the head swivels roughly 360 degrees to make peeling more ergonomically pleasing.  After using a craptastic peeler for years, this peeler literally made my day.  Just for kicks, I peeled a whole giant bag of organic carrots.  Took me less than half the time it normally would have, and my hand wasn't even sore.

I use to buy the 3"" gel / visco memory foam from Costco when it was advertised as ~= 4lb and just replace about once a year when it broke down / bottomed out in the sleeping area.  Over the last year or two they took the ""4lb"" off of the package advertising and went with what seems to be a lower density foam that you sink into and that breaks down and bottoms out in less than 6 months. As a test, I used the digital bathroom scale while holding both products.  The weight of this 2"" memory foam was identical to the current 3"" memory foam from Costco - in other words, this 2"" topper is ~ 50% denser then the ""too soft"" one that Costco currently stocks in the warehouse for sale.  If it holds up over time, I'll keep buying it.

Update: 4/2016 This topper broke down after about 6 months so I purchased another from the same vendor.  The new one does not provide the support expected from a 5lb density memory foam topper and was too squishy from day one.  If you are spending the extra $$ for a 5lb FIRM memory foam topper instead of the cheaper, softer 3-4lb foam toppers, look elsewhere.","so far, so good. this is a nice dense foam. i use to buy the 3"" gel / visco memory foam from costco when it was advertised as ~= 4lb and just replace about once a year when it broke down / bottomed out in the sleeping area. over the last year or two they took the ""4lb"" off of the package advertising and went with what seems to be a lower density foam that you sink into and that breaks down and bottoms out in less than 6 months. as a test, i used the digital bathroom scale while holding both products. the weight of this 2"" memory foam was identical to the current 3"" memory foam from costco - in other words, this 2"" topper is ~ 50% denser then the ""too soft"" one that costco currently stocks in the warehouse for sale. if it holds up over time, i'll keep buying it.

A108OBWC3RJNBV,B000PWGZOI,"I bought this chair a few weeks ago to replace a $700 leather chair that I selected many years ago because it fit me perfectly. I'm 5' 10"" with short legs. This chair is a little too high for me without shoes and the bottom is a little too deep. Despite that, it is comfortable and fairly supportive, even for long work sessions. The bottom felt too firm at first, but it is now OK after some use. I especially like the arm rests, which are wide and comfortable.

The chair arrived in a big, cube box with minimal packing or packing inside. One of the legs of the base had punched through the box, but it was undamaged. Assembly took about 15 minutes with the clear instructions. The bolts and washers are helpfully grouped on a blister card that is labeled for each assembly step. It comes with a hex wrench.

Given the price of this chair, I am pleased with the quality. It looks stylish and well-made--better than the chairs I saw at big box stores in the price range. The bonded leather looks real, and it does not have a big, ugly plastic framework holding up the chair back. My desk has a keyboard drawer, and the arm rests go under it when adjusted to their low position. That's a good thing.

The downside of this chair is a lack of adjustability (4 stars). The chair and arms adjust up and down and you can vary the stiffness of the recline mechanism. That's it. If I could move the seat bottom back 1/2 inch, this chair would fit me very well.","i bought this chair a few weeks ago to replace a $700 leather chair that i selected many years ago because it fit me perfectly. i'm 5' 10"" with short legs. this chair is a little too high for me without shoes and the bottom is a little too deep. despite that, it is comfortable and fairly supportive, even for long work sessions. the bottom felt too firm at first, but it is now ok after some use. i especially like the arm rests, which are wide and comfortable.

A1MFIIB31NKUTA,B00NGV3X2W,"I have a Vitamix, but decided to purchase this little blender for daily smoothies.  I like that the containers and the blade can be put in the dishwasher and it takes up less room on my counter.  Three three containers of different sizes should suit most needs and the screw on to go lids make it easy to head out the door.  No need to transfer to another container or glass. I note the complaints about leaking.  I have found that if I carefully screw on the blender blade top, no leaks occur.  However, you have to make sure it is screwed on correctly--sometimes I have to try a few times.  My favorite feature is the auto blend cycle.  No hovering over it to make sure all of the ingredients are tamped down to the blade.  In comparison to my Vitamix, the result is about the same with the exception that it does not grind up fruit seeds (blackberries) as well as the Vitamix.  That being said, I'm very happy with purchase.

A3LGT6UZL99IW1,B00RWYSNQU,"I'd never heard of copper mugs until I was asked to review this one. I'd also never heard of a Moscow Mule - although now that I've made a few I like them - I've always been a Ginger Beer fan.

The mug weighs 6.4 ounces - the mug itself is solid copper, the handle looks like bronze.  The handle is tack-welded to the mug and feels really solid (I could not pull it off.)

The physics of copper is pretty amazing, from it's antimicrobial properties to conductivity, strength to looks.  This mug is unlined and uncoated, so it will attain a darker color/patina with age. Copper mugs can outlast their owners!  The inside and outside are polished, while the bottom has a slight texture for a *slightly* non-slip base. These are strictly for cold drinks, and these do feel colder.  Colder in the hand and on the lips.

The mug definitely has a look that does not scream ""mass produced"" but still has a quality look and feel.

Whether you're looking for that cool display for your bar, or the perfect mug for specialty drinks (like the mule and it's several variations), be sure to give these a try.","i'd never heard of copper mugs until i was asked to review this one. i'd also never heard of a moscow mule - although now that i've made a few i like them - i've always been a ginger beer fan.

AUAX1QWUCYKSX,B019U2XIZM,"This is not your traditional bean bag. It's foam instead of the typical material and this makes it different in a number of ways.

From those that have tried this at our house, many think it lacks the comfort of a more traditional bag. Personally I think it feels quite nice but I have trouble getting into a comfortable position (mostly back support issues) and it may just be that this isn't the right size for an adult (even a small one like myself). They do make a variety of sizes though, and as I said, I personally like the material and think it's quite nice.

The cover feel nice as well and is washable. The charcoal color goes nicely with a lot of decor. Another issue I have though is that this always looks quite tall; because of the foam filling it never looks like a typical bean bag as it's always fluffed up. To me this just looks a bit strange when someone isn't sitting on it.

Overall though everything about this is good quality, and if you get an appropriate size you should be happy with it (although do make sure you have the space because they seem to take up quite a bit).","this is not your traditional bean bag. it's foam instead of the typical material and this makes it different in a number of ways.

A1VDTGV0Z2IZBR,B000KKUYCY,"I wanted my knives to have the following characteristics: 1. sharp 2. Lightweight  3. Thin blade. 4. The feel it will last forever.

They are most definately sharp.  Very light weight.  Thinner blade compared to some German knives.  I also got the feeling they would last forever due to the handle being metal too.  Other knives you may have to worry about the rivets or deteriorating wood handles.

Handles: I bought these online based on reviews and the pictures here on Amazon.  In the pictures I thought the black dots may have been some kind of rubber for grip.  I wasn't too keen of the thought of potentially having little pieces of rubber glued to the knife.  I ordered this set anyway and was pleasantly surprised that the dots are just colored dimples like a golf ball.

Utility knife grip: Looking at the picture of the utility knife I was  worried about the grip because the handle looks a little different.  I immediately washed this knife upon receiving it and used it to chop up some veggies.  I found it very comfortable to use.  No concerns with the grip at all.

This unit has the humidistat, and I find it worth the extra cost. The unit is VERY easy to clean. Basically the only items that get wet are the tank, the filter and the tray that the two items sit in. All are very easy to remove and wash/rinse.
My only suggestion is if you'd like to cut down the amount of refills to get the bigger 3.5 gallon model.

A25ETSRJXMWEIG,B00CJ1HF7O,"This is a Keurig machine, it just has the Mr. Coffee name on it, and it was less expensive than the same model under the Keurig brand. I don't understand that, but if I can save money, I'm all for it.  I bought this because it's just two of us, we're retired and home most days. We'd make a pot of coffee everyday, then we were always reheating coffee through out the day. Some days we ran out of coffee by afternoon, other times there was coffee leftover the next day. This seemed like the perfect solution. And I purchased the little red cups and filters so I could use my own coffee. Sounded economical. The problem however, is that the coffee is weak. I've tried different kinds of coffee, but so far, none are great.

A38BU6KGHFU8KZ,B000R2WEJQ,"I woke up this morning, and for the first time I can remember I could breathe out of my nose.

I've had this air cleaner running about half time for about a week now. I didn't think I would notice a difference. I did. Not only does it seem to reduce allergic reaction causing nasal buildup when I sleep, it also appears to have drastically reduced nasal buildup throughout the rest of the day, even in cold weather like today. Usually my nose runs more or less continuously in winter. Today I worked all day in the garden without a dribble. Highly unusual, and without any rain recently there is no other change to which I can attribute this effect. I am sold on this filter!

I also measured the noise levels with a decibel meter for those of you concerned about noise (as I am). The low setting emits about 55 decibels; the medium, about 70 decibels; and ""Quick Clean"" or ""High"" emits about 80 decibels. The highest setting is loud enough to be bothersome; the lowest setting is like having a soothing noise machine in the background. I could probably fall asleep to it, though I'd prefer not to. I highly recommend this air filter.","i woke up this morning, and for the first time i can remember i could breathe out of my nose.

With some trepidation, I followed the advice I had read on several RV forums to stack the dishes together and set them on the foam shelf liner in the cabinet.  I was concerned that having the dishes rattle together in transit might damage or break them.  Neither occurred in more than 600 miles of travel on rough and bumpy roads.

AIL1NG766MP56,B00EE0FAVG,This skillet is beautiful. It sparkles and looks so rich! I almost didn't want to cook with it because the eggplant color is amazing. No worries though. I made scrambled eggs with chorizo and didn't even come close to sticking. Best part is there aren't any rivets inside the pan where the handle attaches. It was the biggest selling point for me and I'm glad we went for it. Clean up was a breeze as everything just wiped right off. Our other cooking set are designed to go from stovetop to oven so there is zero non-stick coating and we were missing a good teflon skillet. This pan arrives packaged really well. It's heavy and well made. The handle is feels sturdy and it's well balanced. Definitely my new favorite brand as we've been picking up several of these now.

A1JZFGZEZVWQPY,B00KXV8KJ4,"Winix Signature Series U450 True-HEPA Air Purifier, with PlasmaWave, combines Winix's advanced technologies to create an effective 5-Stage air cleaning system. The Signature Series removes a broad range of odors, allergens, and other airborne pollutants, including: dust, smoke, pollen, pet dander, mold, bacteria, viruses, and VOCs.
Features True-HEPA Filtration PlasmaWave Technology 4 Fan Speeds.

You can also just set it on automatic with the touch control panel on the top of unit and not be concerned with fan speeds. The sensor will alert the Winix if the air gets bad and kick up the fan speed. And yes your dog passing gas will set it up to turbo speed automatically.

This is the third Winix I have. I also have the 5500 and a small one I can't remember the model other than its a plasma wave too, and looks like a tiny version of this beast.

Yeah it's big. It can filter a lot of air even on low quiet mode that is perfect for bedroom. My Vornado is too noisy for bedroom really and this Winix will most likely be replacing it in that room. My Winix 5500 has been retired for a bit until I scrounge up the sixty five bucks for a new hepa filter for it.

AZ10Z4SW509P1,B00WIRLXUE,"After comparing prices and quality on Amazon, I ultimately decided to purchase the Epica hand blender. The main sell for me was the 3-year warranty and the price.

The hand blender itself is powerful. If you haven't heard of Newton's third law (every action has an equal and opposite reaction), then just hold this blender in the air and press ""Turbo."" You will feel your hand jerk in the opposite direction of the spin of the blade.

I've used the immersion blender attachment for several things so far. I have used it to blend sodium alginate into water for spherification, blending cheese into a sauce with sodium citrate, and a few other similar things. It does a good job, and creates a good whirlpool in a pot. For the price of this set, the hand blender makes the whole purchase worth it.

The reason I am rating this as four stars instead of five, is that the extras are flimsy. The plastic construction of the chopper and the larger cylinder is very thin. I feel that I will crack them in very little time. The chopping attachment does work well. I have used it to chop carrots, kale, bananas, and other things. The extras each come with their own lids, which is handy. I'm just afraid these will break before long.

A12LHP16M5HIV7,B005EOAOUI,"I came across FurryBones completely by chance. I was searching 'unicorn' to buy a friend a gift. The unique 'cuteness' with the Jack Skellington face really caught my attention; I ordered it immediately, for myself. LMAO. The next day I ordered two more.

The day I received it I was on the way to work and showed it to co-workers/friends. They were impressed with the quality and uniqueness.

They are better quality than expected- sturdy, hand-painted, and approximately two inches high. Most of the extensive collection runs $8, the most expensive being $14. With free Prime shipping, when purchasing the first, I figured 'if it's cheap or I don't like it, not a big deal.'

When my friends, both male and female, saw it they all agreed it was unique and 'cool,' suiting my personality perfectly. They were also surprised when I told them the price- they thought it would have cost more.

As we began looking through the various figures online, we all found ourselves saying, 'I love that one,' only to find ourselves saying it again and again. They somehow pull off 'cute' without being too feminine, of course some are more than others. The vampire bat holding a blood filled syringe is awesome.

The variety makes them perfect for an inexpensive gift that fits anybody that has a favorite animal.

I've never really been a nicknack collector, generally saying, affectionately, figurine collections are for 'old cat ladies,' and making fun of my mom and female friends for having such collections.

With three arrived, I plan on buying more. There are some awesome dinosaurs, and holiday themed ones. To keep myself from going crazy and buying to many, I open on getting one every other week with my pay check... and I'm not ashamed lol.","i came across furrybones completely by chance. i was searching 'unicorn' to buy a friend a gift. the unique 'cuteness' with the jack skellington face really caught my attention; i ordered it immediately, for myself. lmao. the next day i ordered two more.

A3FZPMEQAO6PAT,B000EGA6QI,"I use this to make smoothies in the morning before work.  I keep bags of fruit in my freezer and then dump them in the measuring cup the mixer came with.  I microwave the cup of fruit for 30 seconds so it's not frozen solid still, add some orange juice and then use the blender.  It mixes up very quickly and then all I do is detach the blade and rinse it in the sink.  Be careful not to get the part of the blade that connects to the handle wet.  My mom has had one of these for a year or two and hers is still in perfect working condition.","i use this to make smoothies in the morning before work. i keep bags of fruit in my freezer and then dump them in the measuring cup the mixer came with. i microwave the cup of fruit for 30 seconds so it's not frozen solid still, add some orange juice and then use the blender. it mixes up very quickly and then all i do is detach the blade and rinse it in the sink. be careful not to get the part of the blade that connects to the handle wet. my mom has had one of these for a year or two and hers is still in perfect working condition.",111.0

A2OSS429YIAIPT,B005638RPQ,"I've had one of these for a few years now.  During a recent move I seemed to have lost it.  My last one was perfect for what I used it for, steaming vegetables in a 4 qt pan.

That said this one came with one of the silicone feet missing.  I didn't even realize it when I received it, but when I went to clean it for the first time I noticed the missing foot.  Now these don't fall off, they are actually quite difficult to remove, so I believe it came from the factory like this.

Anyway It's not really worth returning, and I can use it in my stainless steel pots, just not my non-stick ones.  So I can't really give it a decent rating knowing it arrived defective.","i've had one of these for a few years now. during a recent move i seemed to have lost it. my last one was perfect for what i used it for, steaming vegetables in a 4 qt pan.

They are very pretty to look at and comfy to lie on, but for all the waking up and looking for my pillow, they do not make for a good nights sleep.  Great for a nap!  These are well made, nice zippers and the white is just beautiful and shiny. Maybe if you had many on your bed you could always find one, but mine goes out into the floor and my bed is on risers so I have to make sure I am awake enough to get on the stool to get out of bed to retrieve it.  :-(","but also very difficult to keep the pillow in position. they are very pretty to look at and comfy to lie on, but for all the waking up and looking for my pillow, they do not make for a good nights sleep. great for a nap! these are well made, nice zippers and the white is just beautiful and shiny. maybe if you had many on your bed you could always find one, but mine goes out into the floor and my bed is on risers so i have to make sure i am awake enough to get on the stool to get out of bed to retrieve it. :-(",110.0

(These are about five inches tall.) The glass is thin at the top and heavily weighted at the bottom, plain in design and yet somehow in its plainness very elegant. Also, the glass is very clear. I haven't dropped one, thankfully, and I'm a little worried about doing that because the glass is thin enough that it's likely to break easily. Let's hope that day never comes.
